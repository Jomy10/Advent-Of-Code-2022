# Day 10

So today we're getting a language that I have written once before, quite some
time ago. **PHP**.

```php
<?php

echo "Hello world\n";

?>
```

Personally, I did not find the instructions very clear today, but the
examples helped clarify. Finally generating Letters was pretty cool.

```
####...##.#..#.###..#..#.#....###..####.
#.......#.#..#.#..#.#..#.#....#..#....#.
###.....#.#..#.###..#..#.#....#..#...#..
#.......#.#..#.#..#.#..#.#....###...#...
#....#..#.#..#.#..#.#..#.#....#.#..#....
#.....##...##..###...##..####.#..#.####.
```

The code today is probably the least elegant solution of all of them.
