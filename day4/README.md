# Day 4

Today we are using C3, which is vey similar to C, but with some cool new features.

It took me while to figure out C3 and come up with the solution. I didn't understand
part 2 at first, which led to many frustrations and some wasted hours. Even wrote a
HashSet implementation I didn't need.

```c3
module hello_world;
import std::io;

fn int main() {
  io::println("Hello world");
  return 0;
}
```

Overall I did like C3, and I might use it more in the future.
