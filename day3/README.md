# Day 3

We'll let the randomize speak again. Since I haven't shown it before, here is the
beautiful Ruby one-liner I use:

```ruby
puts [
  "C",
  "C3",
  "Zig",
  "Rust",
  "Swift",
  "JS",
  "TS",
  # "Java",
  # "ShellScript",
  "Go",
  "Crystal",
].sample
```

We'll let it run now:

So today is Rust! A little sad that the langauge I'm most proefficient in comes
so early. The input parsing is roughly the same as last time, but instead of it
being a whole class with quite a few lines, it can be condenced to literaly 2
lines of code. Iterator in Rust are amazing.

Not much trouble today. It didn't take as long as yesterday ofcourse.
