# Advent Of Code 2022

This year for Advent of Code, I will randomly pick another language each day to
solve the puzzles. This is a combination of languages I know and languages I'd
like to learn (Crystal and C3). As the days progressed, I also added some languages
categorized as "langauges I've used like one before" to the list, because I was
running out of languages.
