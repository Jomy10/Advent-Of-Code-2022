# Day 7

Day 7 sounded like a great problem for a low-level language like C, which is the only
real low-leel language in the list. The randomize chose Go, which is also a nice language.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
  fmt.Println("Hello world")
}
```

Today's challenge got me solving a problem which I struggle with every day: freeing up
disk space.
